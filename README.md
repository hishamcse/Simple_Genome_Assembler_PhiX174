# Simple_Genome_Assembler_PhiX174
The phi X 174 bacteriophage is a single-stranded DNA virus that infects Escherichia coli (E. Coli), and the first DNA-based genome to be sequenced. 
This work was completed by Fred Sanger and his team in 1977. This repository contains simple assembler, different components of it and various error correction techniques for assembling Phi X 174 bacteriophage.<br />
